# Bitcoin node from scratch

This tutorial shows you how to install a Bitcoin node with lightning and several applications from scratch, using Docker technology.

## Why?

You may be asking why not install Umbrel directly? Umbrel is great, but still there are several reasons why you may want to install your own node from scratch:

- You want to fine tune everything, up to any possible parameter, in any application.
- You want to learn how a Bitcoin node works from the inside out, understand the magic happening in the background.
- You want to be able to choose versions of everything.
- You want to have custom network requirements, including having both an static IP or Tor, or advanced inverse socks proxy from an VPN.
